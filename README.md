Hi! This is Thom who is built fixing bob.

When reading the scripts, just starts of with Rotatable elements and Imoveable Item. This 
will be helpful to understand what is going on in the other script. So of the concepts can 
be hard so I recommend you to just play around with the prefabs to better understand how the 
script works:)
